## ‚ú® Features

- **Intelligent Validation**  
  AI-driven analysis of API responses for correctness, structure, and content.
  
- **Performance & Reliability**  
  Detect latency issues, error patterns, and stability concerns in real time.

- **Structured Reports**  
  Clear, actionable reports with debugging suggestions and AI insights.

- **Multi-API Support**  
  Works seamlessly with REST, GraphQL, and other HTTP-based APIs.

- **Intuitive UI**  
  Clean, user-friendly web interface powered by Gradio.

- **Theme Options**  
  Choose between Light, Dark, or System theme for optimal viewing.

- **Screen Studio (Beta)**  
  Record and enhance your testing sessions for documentation or debugging.

## üí° How It Works

1. **Input**  
   Enter the API URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and expected response fields.

2. **Request & Response**  
   The app sends the request and captures the full response (headers, body, status).

3. **AI Analysis**  
   Our AI validates the response against your criteria ‚Äî checks data types, required fields, formats, and more.

4. **Reporting**  
   Get a comprehensive report including:
   - Status code
   - Response time
   - Field validation results
   - AI-generated suggestions for fixes or improvements

## üéØ Why Use It?

Automate repetitive API testing tasks with intelligent validation. Ideal for:

- Validating response formats (e.g., JSON schema)
- Security checks (e.g., missing headers, exposed data)
- Performance benchmarking
- Regression testing
- Auto-generating test documentation
- Onboarding new developers with smart feedback

Perfect for developers, QA engineers, and DevOps teams.

result = client.predict(
    api_url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1",
    method="GET",
    expected_fields="userId, id, title, body",
    api_name="/test_api"
)
print(result)
```
